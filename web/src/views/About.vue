    abstract: 'Herein lies the litepaper for Hashed Comments.  A simple distributed app that hashes comment sections into the Ethereum Event Logs.  The product than aught to be uncensorable, insofar that no middleman can arbitrate the discourse that takes places therein. Consistent, as it portains that an arbitrary set of random individuals are guaranteed to see the same comment section. And lastly, more costly for shills and AI Bot swarms, meaning those who multiply their words ad nauseum will have to indure proportionally more costs. Hopefully the act of paying a minisule fee per post will motivate a higher calibur of discourse. Its uncensorability enables a greater overton window of ideas. Its consistency restoring sanctity to actors assuming they are being exposed to the same information actually are, and that the signal to noise ratio will be higher as shills, propagandists and chatbots cant post thousands of comments for a single genuine and passionate humans post for the same price.',
    body: 'The last several years has seen major leaps and strides in publicly available and easily deploy-able Neural Networks that forge grammatically correct logic into aptly worded rhetoric.  In what takes a human being decades to master, and even then hours to write, Chatbots (or, as the greatest programmer that ever lived would call them, Tongues machines), can do in a matter of seconds.  Coinciding with this development is the ever more drastic cultural imperialism that has seen propaganda once again be deployed domestically against its own citizens a la NDAA 2013.  In what was envisioned as a tool to enable people to communicate together, the internet has been, from behind the scenes, turned into a place where individuals are, in some places, alone talking to 99 chatbots for every 1 human post. Indeed, Marshall Mcluhans quote WW3 is a guerilla information war with no distinction between civilian and military participation rings true- the war has come for us all.  The Techniques of psychological warfare have been deployed onto the un suspecting masses. Pavlovian reinforcement learning guides what images and text one sees one after the other, determined by ones emotional state preened from the front facing Infrared Cameras.  1000s of correlating factors in an individuals psychographic profile are used to the explicit purpose of driving a certain behaviour. Shadow banning not just of illegal content, but on a case by case basis, providing alternate comment section realities to each user, each assuming other people are looking at the same thing. Personalized AIs middlemanning ones information stream, CRUDding according to the parameters of their shadowy creators.  It is in light of these advents that I take this time to write Hashed Comments, which through its design offers a certain amount of protection against these mind parasites. By hashing comment sections into the ethereum event logs, a degree of relatively cheap ephemeral chat is born that is uncensorable, guaranteed to remain consistent between to sets of eyes and one that forces any AI that want to write 100 posts for every 1 user generated one to pay 100x more in network fees to support public blockchain technology.  The rest of this paper will tell itself in images that illustrate the need for technology like this. (Content Warning: Some may be rather uncomfortable)',
    conclusion: 'If you made it through those text walls, I applaud you, within them are many uncomfortable postulates and assertions. For this writer here I define my pursuit so as not to get lost in the culture war.  This pursuit for me is getting human beings talking over the internet again, forging our futures together from genuinine passionate discourse, the solutions provided so far for myself have ran their limits and I no longer feel safe keeping my mindspace there, in the praxis of Information warfare, and outrunning the AI, hopefully the conversations that evolve here have the affect of keeping us all freerer and thus counterintuiviely more safe.'
